## Why QMK?

QMK is an aftermarket community firmware developed for keyboards with compatible MCUs. QMK allows for you to make any layout of your choice that your PCB is capable of having.

## Will this void my warranty?

Flashing QMK will not void your warranty, and the Glorious [discord](https://discord.gg/pRdUuCZYkY) has stock firmware pinned in the #keyboards channel.


## What should I know before starting?

Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of flashing: Every time you modify your keyboard in any way, there is always a chance that you could brick your board. It is, however, very rare for a pcb to be rendered completely unrecoverable.
